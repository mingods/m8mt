```sql
SAVEPOINT identifier
ROLLBACK [WORK] TO [SAVEPOINT] identifier
RELEASE SAVEPOINT identifier
```

InnoDB supports the SQL statements SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, RELEASE SAVEPOINT and the optional WORK keyword for ROLLBACK.

InnoDB 支持 保存点，回滚到保存点，保存点版本 SQL 语句，ROLLBACK 有额外的关键字 WORK。

The SAVEPOINT statement sets a named transaction savepoint with a name of identifier. If the current transaction has a savepoint with the same name, the old savepoint is deleted and a new one is set.

SAVEPOINT 语句用一个标识符来设置一个命名的事务保存点。如果当前事务设置了相同名称的保存点，则旧的保存点会被删除，新的将被设置。

The ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement rolls back a transaction to the named savepoint without terminating the transaction. Modifications that the current transaction made to rows after the savepoint was set are undone in the rollback, but InnoDB does not release the row locks that were stored in memory after the savepoint. (For a new inserted row, the lock information is carried by the transaction ID stored in the row; the lock is not separately stored in memory. In this case, the row lock is released in the undo.) Savepoints that were set at a later time than the named savepoint are deleted.

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT 语句回滚事务到命名的保存点（不会结束事务）。当前事务在设置保存点以后对行所做的修改会在回滚中撤销，但是 InnoDB 不会释放保存点之后存储在内存中的行锁。（对于新插入的行，锁信息由存储在行中的事务 ID 携带；锁不是单独存储在内存中。在这种情况下，行锁在撤销中被释放）在指定保存点之后的时间设置的保存点将被删除。

If the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement returns the following error, it means that no savepoint with the specified name exists:

如果 ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT 语句返回以下错误，这意味着指定名称的保存点不存在：

```sql
ERROR 1305 (42000): SAVEPOINT identifier does not exist
```

The RELEASE SAVEPOINT statement removes the named savepoint from the set of savepoints of the current transaction. No commit or rollback occurs. It is an error if the savepoint does not exist.

RELEASE STATEMENT 语句从当前事务的保存点集合中删除命名的保存点。没有提交或者回滚发生。如果保存点不存在则会报错。

All savepoints of the current transaction are deleted if you execute a COMMIT, or a ROLLBACK that does not name a savepoint.

如果执行了一个 COMMIT 或者一个不包含保存点名称的 ROLLBACK，则当前事务的所有保存点都将会被删除。

A new savepoint level is created when a stored function is invoked or a trigger is activated. The savepoints on previous levels become unavailable and thus do not conflict with savepoints on the new level. When the function or trigger terminates, any savepoints it created are released and the previous savepoint level is restored.

调度存储函数或者激活触发器时，将创建新的保存点级别。以前级别上的保存点将不可用，因此不会与新级别上的保存点冲突。当函数或者触发器终止时，将释放它创建的所有保存点，并恢复以前的保存点级别。

```sql
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP

UNLOCK INSTANCE
```

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP acquires an instance-level backup lock that permits DML during an online backup while preventing operations that could result in an inconsistent snapshot.

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 获取一个实例级别备份锁，该锁允许在线备份期间进行 DML，同时防止可能导致快照不一致的操作。

Executing the LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP statement requires the BACKUP_ADMIN privilege. The BACKUP_ADMIN privilege is automatically granted to users with the RELOAD privilege when performing an in-place upgrade to MySQL 8.0 from an earlier version.

执行 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 语句要求 BACKUP_ADMIN 权限。当执行从早期版本到 MySQL8 的本地升级时，BACKUP_ADMIN 权限会自动赋予拥有 RELOAD 权限的用户 

Multiple sessions can hold a backup lock simultaneously.

多个 sessions 可以同时持有一个备份锁。

UNLOCK INSTANCE releases a backup lock held by the current session. A backup lock held by a session is also released if the session is terminated.

UNLOCK INSTANCE 释放被当前 session 持有的备份锁。如果 session 结束，那么被该 session 持有的备份锁也将释放。

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP prevents files from being created, renamed, or removed. REPAIR TABLE TRUNCATE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, and account management statements are blocked. See Section 13.7.1, “Account Management Statements”. Operations that modify InnoDB files that are not recorded in the InnoDB redo log are also blocked.

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 防止文件被创建，重命名，或者移除。REPAIR TABLE TRUNCATE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, 账户管理语句会阻塞。参考章节 13.7.1 账户管理语句。对于修改 InnoDB 文件的操作，如果没有记录在 InnoDB redo log 中，也会被阻塞。

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP permits DDL operations that only affect user-created temporary tables. In effect, files that belong to user-created temporary tables can be created, renamed, or removed while a backup lock is held. Creation of binary log files is also permitted.

LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 允许只影响用户创建的临时表的 DDL 操作。实际上，当持有备份锁时，属于用户创建的临时表的文件可以被创建、重命名或者删除。创建 binary log 文件也被允许。

PURGE BINARY LOGS should not be issued while a LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP statement is in effect for the instance, because it contravenes the rules of the backup lock by removing files from the server. From MySQL 8.0.28, this is disallowed.

当 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 语句对实例生效时，不应该使用 PURGE BINARY LOGS，因为它会从服务器上删除文件，这违反了备份锁的规则。从 MySQL 8.0.28，这是不允许。

A backup lock acquired by LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP is independent of transactional locks and locks taken by FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK, and the following sequences of statements are permitted:

通过 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 获取备份锁跟事务锁和通过 FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK 获取的表锁是独立的，以下顺序语句是允许的：

```sql
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP;
FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK;
UNLOCK TABLES;
UNLOCK INSTANCE;
```

```sql
FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK;
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP;
UNLOCK INSTANCE;
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

The lock_wait_timeout setting defines the amount of time that a LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP statement waits to acquire a lock before giving up.

lock_wait_timeout 设置定义了 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP 语句在放弃之前等待获得锁的时间。

```sql
show variables like '%lock_wait_timeout%'; -- 31536000 一年
```

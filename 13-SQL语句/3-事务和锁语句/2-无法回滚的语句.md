Some statements cannot be rolled back. In general, these include data definition language (DDL) statements, such as those that create or drop databases, those that create, drop, or alter tables or stored routines.

有些语句不能回滚。通常，这些语句包含数据定义语言（DDL）语句，比如创建或者删除数据库，创建、删除、更改表或者存储程序。

You should design your transactions not to include such statements. If you issue a statement early in a transaction that cannot be rolled back, and then another statement later fails, the full effect of the transaction cannot be rolled back in such cases by issuing a ROLLBACK statement.

事务中不应该包含这些语句。如果在事务前期包含这些无法回滚的语句，随后有语句执行失败，事务的整个影响都不能被回滚，即使后面执行了 ROLLBACK 语句。
